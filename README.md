# Countdown
Countdown App on Pyqt6

Finally a Pyqt6 app without ChatGPT help (but github copilot)

# How to run

First change the url on the file

Second (**If you want so**) change programs name where i marked the "Program Name"

Third run it using terminal

Windows : python countdown.py
*nix : python3 countdown.py

# How it works

Just loads the url. Nothing Special

Also i added a Always on top function!

# Examples

I did a countdown until 1/1/2024 so i will be more calm. BECAUSE I WANT THE NEW YEAR ATMOSPHERE!
